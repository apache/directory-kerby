Apache Kerby
============

Apache Kerby, as an [Apache Directory](http://directory.staging.apache.org/) sub project, is a Java Kerberos binding. It provides a rich, intuitive and interoperable implementation, library, KDC and various facilities that integrates PKI, OTP and token (OAuth2) as desired in modern environments such as cloud, Hadoop and mobile.

### The Initiatives/Goals 
- Aims as a Java Kerberos binding, with rich and integrated facilities that integrate Kerberos, PKI and token (OAuth2) for both client and server sides.
- Provides client APIs at the Kerberos protocol level to interact with a KDC server through AS and TGS exchanges.
- Provides a standalone KDC server that supports various identity backends including memory based, Json file based, LDAP based and even Zookeeper based.
- Provides an embedded KDC server that applications can easily integrate into products, unit tests or integration tests.
- Supports FAST/Preauthentication framework to allow popular and useful authentication mechanisms.
- Supports PKINIT mechanism to allow clients to request tickets using x509 certificate credentials.
- Supports Token Preauth mechanism to allow clients to request tickets using JWT tokens.
- Supports OTP mechanism to allow clients to request tickets using One Time Password.
- Provides support for JAAS, GSSAPI and SASL frameworks that applications can leverage.
- Minimal dependencies, the core part is ensured to depend only on JRE and SLF4J, for easy use and maintenance.

### KrbClient APIs
A Krb client API for applications to interact with KDC.  
Please look at [kerb-client](docs/1.0.0-rc2/krbclient.md) for details.

### Kadmin
Server side admin facilities.  
Please look at [kerb-admin](docs/1.0.0-rc2/kadmin.md) for details.

### KdcServer
Kerberos Server API.  
Please look at [kerb-server](docs/1.0.0-rc2/kdcserver.md) for details.

### SimpleKdcServer
A simplified Kdc server. It can be imported by other project to work as a kdc server.  
Please look at [kerb-simplekdc](docs/1.0.0-rc2/simplekdc.md) for details.

### ASN-1 support
A model driven ASN-1 encoding and decoding framework implemented with Java.  
Please look at [kerby-asn1](docs/1.0.0-rc2/kerby-asn1.md) for details.

### How to play with the standalone KDC
Please look at [Kerby KDC](kerby-dist/README.md) for details.

### Kerberos Crypto and Encryption Types
- Implementing des, des3, rc4, aes, camellia encryption and corresponding checksum types
- Interoperates with MIT Kerberos and Microsoft AD
- Independent of Kerberos code in JRE, but relies on JCE

Similar to [MIT krb5 encryption types](http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.14/doc/admin/conf_files/kdc_conf.html#encryption-types):

| Encryption Type | Description |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| des-cbc-crc | DES cbc mode with CRC-32 (weak) |
| des-cbc-md4 | DES cbc mode with RSA-MD4 (weak) |
| des-cbc-md5 | DES cbc mode with RSA-MD5 (weak) |
| des3-cbc-sha1 des3-hmac-sha1 des3-cbc-sha1-kd | Triple DES cbc mode with HMAC/sha1 |
| des-hmac-sha1 | DES with HMAC/sha1 (weak) |
| aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96 aes256-cts AES-256 | CTS mode with 96-bit SHA-1 HMAC |
| aes128-cts-hmac-sha1-96 aes128-cts AES-128 | CTS mode with 96-bit SHA-1 HMAC |
| arcfour-hmac rc4-hmac arcfour-hmac-md5 | RC4 with HMAC/MD5 |
| arcfour-hmac-exp rc4-hmac-exp arcfour-hmac-md5-exp | Exportable RC4 with HMAC/MD5 (weak) |
| camellia256-cts-cmac camellia256-cts | Camellia-256 CTS mode with CMAC |
| camellia128-cts-cmac camellia128-cts | Camellia-128 CTS mode with CMAC |
| des | The DES family: des-cbc-crc, des-cbc-md5, and des-cbc-md4 (weak) |
| des3 | The triple DES family: des3-cbc-sha1 |
| aes | The AES family: aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96 and aes128-cts-hmac-sha1-96 |
| rc4 | The RC4 family: arcfour-hmac |
| camellia | The Camellia family: camellia256-cts-cmac and camellia128-cts-cmac |

### Identity Backend
A standalone KDC server that can integrate various identity backends including:
- MemoryIdentityBackend.
  - It is default Identity Backend, and no cofiguration is needed. This backend is for no permanent storage requirements.
- JsonIdentityBackend.
  - It implemented by Gson which is used to convert Java Objects into their JSON representation and convert a JSON string to an equivalent Java object. A json file will be created in "backend.json.dir". This backend is for small, easy, development and test environment.
- ZookeeperIdentityBackend.
  - Currently it uses an embedded Zookeeper. In follow up it will be enhanced to support standalone Zookeeper cluster for
  replication and reliability. Zookeeper backend would be a good choice for high reliability, high performance and high scalability requirement and scenarios. 
- LdapIdentityBackend.
  - The Ldap server can be standalone or embedded using ApacheDS server as the backend. It is used when there is exist ldap server.
- MavibotBackend.
  - A backend based on Apache Mavibot(an MVCC BTree library).

### Network Support
- Include UDP and TCP transport.
- Default KDC server implementation.
  - The Networking Classes in the JDK is used.
- Netty based KDC server implementation.
  - Netty is an asynchronous event-driven network application framework for rapid development of maintainable high    performance protocol servers & clients.
  - With better throughput, lower latency.

### Tools
- kinit:
  - Obtains and caches an initial ticket-granting ticket for principal.
- klist:
  - Lists the Kerby principal and tickets held in a credentials cache, or the keys held in a keytab file.
- kdcinit:
  - This is used to initialize and prepare all kinds of KDC side materials, like initializing concrete back end, setting up master keys, necessary principals (tgs, kadmin) and etc.
- kadmin:
  - Command-line interfaces to the Kerby administration system.

#### Kerby Common Projects
- kerby-asn1. A model driven ASN-1 encoding and decoding framework
- kerby-config. A unified configuration API that aims to support various configuration file formats, like XML, INI, even Java Map and Properties.
- kerby-util. Common utilities used by project.

### Dependency
- The core part is ensured to only depend on the JRE and SLF4J. Every external dependency is taken carefully and maintained separately.
- [Nimbus JOSE + JWT](http://connect2id.com/products/nimbus-jose-jwt), needed by token-provider and TokenPreauth mechanism.
- [Netty](http://netty.io/), needed by netty based KDC server.
- [Zookeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/), needed by zookeeper identity backend.
